## Why?

YouTube Music and Spotify don't talk to each other. If you curate playlists on one platform you either listen on two platforms or manually rebuild them. This tool automates the bridge: it reads your YT Music playlist, finds the matching tracks on Spotify, and keeps the two in sync. Only changes since the last run are processed — no full re-scan, no duplicates.

---

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Live YT Music API** | Fetches your playlist directly via `ytmusicapi` — no manual export required |
| **3-pass smart matching** | ISRC exact match → normalised title + artist → fuzzy fallback with duration validation |
| **Diff-based sync** | JSON snapshots track playlist state; only added/removed tracks are touched each run |
| **Spotify playlist management** | Adds new matches and removes deleted tracks automatically |
| **Audio features enrichment** | Annotates every track with danceability, energy, valence, tempo, key, and 7 more |
| **Metadata enrichment** | Captures ISRC, explicit flag, album release date, popularity, and artist genres from Spotify |
| **Artist genre tagging** | Fetches genre tags for each primary artist via the Spotify `/artists` endpoint |
| **CSV fallback** | Works from a CSV export if you prefer not to use the live API |
| **Resume after rate limits** | Match progress is cached every 25 tracks; re-running continues where you left off |
| **Quota-friendly `--limit`** | Cap new tracks per run to stay within Spotify's daily API quota |
| **Interactive menu** | Run without arguments for a guided, looping step-by-step experience |
| **Dry-run mode** | Preview every change before it is applied |
| **Unmatched tracking** | Saves failed matches to `data/unmatched.csv` for manual review or later retry |

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidmalko87/ytmusic-to-spotify-sync.git
cd ytmusic-to-spotify-sync
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your credentials:

| Variable | Where to get it |
|----------|----------------|
| `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID` | [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) → Create App |
| `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET` | Same app page, under "Settings" |
| `SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI` | Set to `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback` and add it in the Spotify app settings |
| `SPOTIFY_PLAYLIST_ID` | Create a playlist on Spotify; the ID is the last segment of its URL |
| `YTMUSIC_PLAYLIST_ID` | From your YT Music playlist URL: `...playlist?list=<ID>` |

### 3. Authenticate YT Music

```bash
python playlist_sync.py setup-ytmusic
```

One-time setup — paste request headers from browser DevTools. Auth is valid for ~2 years.

<details>
<summary>How to get the request headers</summary>

1. Open [music.youtube.com](https://music.youtube.com) in your browser (logged in)
2. Press **F12** to open DevTools
3. Go to the **Network** tab and type `/browse` in the filter bar
4. Click on any playlist or page in YT Music to trigger a request
5. Find a **POST** request to `browse` with **status 200**
6. Click it → **Headers** tab → **Request Headers**
7. Copy all the request headers and paste them into the terminal when prompted

Both the Chrome two-line format and the standard `key: value` format are accepted.

</details>

### 4. Run your first sync

```bash
# Preview what would happen (no changes made)
python playlist_sync.py sync --dry-run

# Run the actual sync
python playlist_sync.py sync
```

## Configuration reference

All options are set via environment variables (`.env` file or shell environment).

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID` | Yes | — | Spotify app client ID |
| `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET` | Yes | — | Spotify app client secret |
| `SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI` | No | `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback` | OAuth redirect URI |
| `SPOTIFY_PLAYLIST_ID` | Yes | — | ID of the target Spotify playlist |
| `YTMUSIC_PLAYLIST_ID` | Yes* | — | ID of the source YT Music playlist (*not needed with `--from-csv`) |
| `YTMUSIC_AUTH_FILE` | No | `browser.json` | Path to the YT Music auth JSON file |
| `SOURCE_CSV` | No | — | Path to a CSV export to use instead of the live API |

## Usage

### Interactive mode

```bash
python playlist_sync.py
```

```
==================================================
  Playlist Sync: YT Music -> Spotify
==================================================

  [1] Setup YT Music auth

### Command-line mode

```bash
python playlist_sync.py setup-ytmusic          # One-time browser auth setup
python playlist_sync.py snapshot               # Save current playlist state
python playlist_sync.py diff                   # Show changes since last snapshot

## How it works

```
YT Music Playlist ──(API or CSV)──> Current State
                                        │
                                    Diff Engine  ←── Previous Snapshot
                                    ╱         ╲
                            Added Tracks   Removed Tracks
                                │               │
                            Matcher         Spotify Remove
                            ╱       ╲
                    Matched     Unmatched
                        │           │
                Spotify Add    unmatched.csv
                        │
                    Enricher  (audio features + metadata)
                        │
              playlist_enriched.csv
```

### Track matching strategy

The matcher runs three passes in order of reliability:

1. **ISRC match** — searches Spotify by `isrc:` query; highest accuracy, ~95 % confidence
2. **Title + Artist** — normalised search (`feat.` stripped, HTML decoded), validated by duration ± 5 s
3. **Relaxed** — title-only search with fuzzy artist matching; catches live versions and alternate releases

Unmatched tracks are written to `data/unmatched.csv` and can be retried later with `retry-unmatched`.

## Output: enriched CSV

The sync produces `data/playlist_enriched.csv` with 37 columns:

| Column | Source |
|--------|--------|
| `title`, `artist`, `album` | YT Music |
| `trackId`, `url`, `duration` | YT Music |
| `spotify_uri`, `spotify_url` | Spotify match |
| `isrc`, `explicit`, `album_release_date` | Spotify metadata |
| `popularity` | Spotify track popularity (0–100) |
| `artist_genres` | Primary artist genre tags (comma-separated) |
| `album_type` | Album type (`album` / `single` / `compilation`) |
| `track_number` | Track position within the album |
| `danceability`, `energy`, `valence` | Spotify audio features |
| `tempo`, `key`, `mode`, `loudness` | Spotify audio features |
| `speechiness`, `acousticness` | Spotify audio features |
| `instrumentalness`, `liveness`, `time_signature` | Spotify audio features |
| `match_method`, `match_confidence` | Matching diagnostics |
| `first_synced`, `last_synced` | Sync timestamps |

### Audio features reference

| Feature | Range | Meaning |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `danceability` | 0.0 – 1.0 | Suitability for dancing (tempo, rhythm, beat strength) |
| `energy` | 0.0 – 1.0 | Intensity and activity (loud, fast, noisy = high) |
| `valence` | 0.0 – 1.0 | Musical positiveness (happy = high, sad/angry = low) |
| `tempo` | BPM | Estimated beats per minute |
| `speechiness` | 0.0 – 1.0 | Presence of spoken words |
| `acousticness` | 0.0 – 1.0 | Confidence the track is acoustic |
| `instrumentalness` | 0.0 – 1.0 | Likelihood of no vocal content |
| `liveness` | 0.0 – 1.0 | Presence of a live audience |
| `loudness` | dB | Overall loudness (typically −60 to 0) |
| `key` | 0 – 11 | Pitch class (0 = C, 1 = C♯, …, 11 = B) |
| `mode` | 0 or 1 | Modality (0 = minor, 1 = major) |
| `time_signature` | int | Estimated beats per bar |

## Known limitations

- **Spotify Developer Mode** limits search to 10 results per request and imposes a daily quota. Use `--limit N` to spread large initial syncs over multiple days.
- **Audio features restricted** — Spotify returns 403 on the `/audio-features` endpoint for most standard app types. The tool detects this and marks tracks as attempted so it won't retry. Popularity, genres, and other metadata still work.
- **YT Music-exclusive tracks** (unreleased, region-locked, user uploads) will not have Spotify matches — these are tracked in `data/unmatched.csv`.
- **ytmusicapi OAuth is broken** in v1.11.x — the tool uses browser-based authentication instead (stable, valid ~2 years).
